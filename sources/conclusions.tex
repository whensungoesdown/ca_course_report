\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this course project, we implemented a very simple 8-bit CPU on FPGA development board using simple TTL logic components such as the 74 series and very small amount of VHDL code. The CPU only has two general registers, and the ALU part can only do addition and subtraction. But it has some typical elements in CPU design such as IR, MAR, PC, memory and control logic. Through this course project, we understand better how a CPU executes an instruction. And have a more intuitive understanding of the bus.
