\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}
In the computer architecture course, we learned about pipelines, branch prediction, multiple issue, reservation stations and etc. But those technologies are very complicated to implement. So we are wondering, aside from these advanced technologies, how does the simplest CPU work? What is a bus? What micro instructions are like? To answer these questions, we decide to learn a very simple CPU. We found a Youtube channel~\footnote{https://www.youtube.com/user/eaterbc} explaining how various CPU components work, and make an 8-bit CPU using TTL logic components. Because we do not have so many kinds of TTL components and we also want to learn about FPGA, we decided to make a similar 8-bit CPU on the FPGA developing board. All the code for this project is uploaded to github~\footnote{https://github.com/whensungoesdown/8bitcpu}.
